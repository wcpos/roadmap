# WCPOS Roadmap

Cross-repo planning and epics for the [WooCommerce POS](https://wcpos.com) project.

This repo contains no code — only issues for tracking features and initiatives that span multiple repositories.

## How It Works

- **Epics** are parent issues here that link to implementation sub-issues in code repos
- **Proposals** are ideas being evaluated before committing to implementation
- Single-repo work stays in its own repo (`woocommerce-pos`, `monorepo`, `electron`, etc.)

## Repos

| Repo | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [woocommerce-pos](https://github.com/wcpos/woocommerce-pos) | WordPress plugin |
| [woocommerce-pos-pro](https://github.com/wcpos/woocommerce-pos-pro) | Pro plugin extension |
| [monorepo](https://github.com/wcpos/monorepo) | React Native app |
| [electron](https://github.com/wcpos/electron) | Desktop app |
